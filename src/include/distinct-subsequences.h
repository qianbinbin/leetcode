/**
 * Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.
 *
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 *
 * As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
 * (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)
 *
 * rabbbit
 * ^^^^ ^^
 * rabbbit
 * ^^ ^^^^
 * rabbbit
 * ^^^ ^^^
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 *
 * As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
 * (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)
 *
 * babgbag
 * ^^ ^
 * babgbag

 * babgbag
