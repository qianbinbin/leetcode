"""
Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.

An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where they are divided into non-empty substrings such that:

s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
|n - m| <= 1
The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...

Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.



Example 1:
https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/02/interleave.jpg

Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""
Output: true


Constraints:

0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
0 <= s3.length <= 200
s1, s2, and s3 consist of lowercase English letters.


Follow up: Could you solve it using only O(s2.length) additional memory space?
