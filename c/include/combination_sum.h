/*
 * Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.
 *
 * The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
 * Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
 * Explanation:
 * 2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
 * 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
 * These are the only two combinations.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
 * Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
 * Output: []
 *
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: candidates = [1], target = 1
 * Output: [[1]]
 *
 * Example 5:
 *
 * Input: candidates = [1], target = 2
 * Output: [[1,1]]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= candidates.length <= 30
 * 1 <= candidates[i] <= 200
 * All elements of candidates are distinct.
 * 1 <= target <= 500
